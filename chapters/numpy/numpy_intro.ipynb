    "## Installing NumPy\n",
    "To use NumPy in your Python projects, you need to install it first. Here’s how you can do it by using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once NumPy is installed, you can start using it in your Python scripts by importing it.\n",
    "It's a common practice to import NumPy with the alias `np`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This alias `np` makes it easier and quicker to access NumPy functions and features throughout your code.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Creating Arrays from Python Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `np.array()`: \n",
    "You can create a NumPy array using the `np.array()` function. This function can convert Python lists and tuples into NumPy arrays.\n",

    "```{admonition} NumPy arrays vs Python Lists\n",
    ":class: note\n",
    "NumPy arrays enforce **homogeneity**, requiring all elements to be of the same data type, which enhances efficiency. \n",
    "They also support **advanced functionalities** like broadcasting and multi-dimensional slicing. \n",
    "In contrast, Python lists are more flexible with data types but lack the performance optimization of NumPy arrays. \n",
    "Lists also do not support element-wise operations or advanced indexing and slicing natively.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Arrays from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides several functions to create arrays from scratch with specific values and shapes. Here are some commonly used functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`np.zeros`**:\n",
    "   - Creates an array filled with zeros.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Creates a 3x4 array of zeros\n",
    "     zeros_array = np.zeros((3, 4))  \n",
    "     print(zeros_array)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **`np.ones`**:\n",
    "   - Creates an array filled with ones.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Creates a 2x5 array of ones\n",
    "     ones_array = np.ones((2, 5))  \n",
    "     print(ones_array)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`np.arange`**:\n",
    "   - Creates an array with a range of values, similar to Python’s `range` but returns an array.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Creates an array with values from 0 to 9\n",
    "     arange_array = np.arange(10)  \n",
    "     print(arange_array)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - You can also specify the start, stop, and step values:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Creates an array with values from 1 to 9, with a step of 2\n",
    "     arange_array_step = np.arange(1, 10, 2)  \n",
    "     print(arange_array_step)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`np.linspace`**:\n",
    "   - Creates an array of evenly spaced values between a specified start and stop value.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     # Creates an array with 5 evenly spaced values between 0 and 1\n",
    "     linspace_array = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)  \n",
    "     print(linspace_array)\n",
    "     ```\n",
